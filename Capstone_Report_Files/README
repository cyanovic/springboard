-In the Capstone_Report_Files folder, the actual report is the Capstone1Report.docx file or alternatively 
Capstone1Report.pdf (format may be better retained, though hyperlinks are not active in the PDF). Please 
start with either of these, as this is the actual report.
-The HeartDiseasePPT_VM.pdf file is a slide deck to accompany the report. 
-The two ipynb files are for the bulk of the code accompanying this report (Capstone1_Main-AllLoc_VM.ipynb) 
or machine learning code specific to analyses of the Cleveland subset (Capstone1_MLCleveland_VM.ipynb). I 
worked on different aspects of the report in different portions of the Jupyter Notebooks, so the order is 
not straightforward or corresponding to the order in which figures/tables are presented in the report, but 
in each notebook I labeled with a header above cells that related to Figures/Tables appearing in the report.
Most unnecessary code has been cleared from both files, but some content that is not referred to in the 
report may remain in them.
