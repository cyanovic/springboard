This folder contains my Capstone 2 Report and associated documents.
The report itself is the Capstone2_Report_VM in both PDF and Word .docx forms.
The slide deck is Capstone2_VM.pdf.
The Jupyter Notebook files are as following:
-ThoracicSurgery_NoPreweightingJustSWinSplit.ipynb is the main one,
  with nearly all the analyses included in it.
-ThoracicSurgery-UpsampleMinorityAfterTrain-Tidy.ipynb, and
-ThoracicSurgery-SmoteAfterTrain.ipynb both contain some content used
  in the earlier stages of the report before I chose to move forward with the
  approach in the "...NoPreweighting..." one mentioned above.
