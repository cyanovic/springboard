    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

A z-test is reasonable here because there is a very large sample size (n=4870), and the data represent the entirety of the experimentally-developed population of interest.

    "Both methods of calculating chi-squared statistics on the data of interest led to a chi-squared value just above 16 (16.9 and 16.4, respectively). The first calculation relied on finding p-values based on critical values for one degree of freedom found in reference tables (p < 0.001 for this statistic). The second calculation using Scipy's chi-squared contingency test function produced a p-value of 0.00005. These results should compel us to reject the null hypothesis that race does not affect callbacks, and with this extremely low p-value this is not an ambiguous result."

    "Each statistical test employed to answer the question of whether race impacts probability of receiving a call provides strong evidence that perception of race is a significant factor in whether an applicant receives a phone call. These tests are not comprehensive enough to address the relative strength of this connection compared with other attributes, but provide a strong enough signal to indicate that race is unambiguously a factor. To evaluate the relative impact of this versus other factors, further univariate tests of individual factors can be done. The most useful analysis would be multivariate in order to determine the impact of race in conjunction with other factors."
